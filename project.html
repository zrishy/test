								<p> Rhythm gaming has always been a part of my life, starting from Guitar Hero and currently it has evolved into where I am now, I play multiple games competetively for teams and myself. </p>
								<p>My Inquiry Question. How does Rhythm Gaming teach new users about competition?</p>
								<p>I have most of my rhythm gaming experience due to playing osu! for five years, it has been with me for nearly a third of my life. osu! has taught me very valuable things in life that have made sports, my outlook on the world, and knowledge improve. 
								<p>osu! is a rhythm game primarily developed, published and created by Dean "peppy" Herbert. Originally released for Microsoft Windows on September 16, 2007, the game has also been ported to macOS. Its gameplay is based on titles including Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, Taiko no Tatsujin, Beatmania IIDX, Elite Beat Agents, O2Jam, and DJMax. The game has an active e-sports community, and is also sometimes recommended by professional players of other games to practice or warm-up.</p>
								<p>Personally, some of the things I have learned from playing these games for extended periods of time, is that moderation and persistence are key to becoming better. Without moderation, persistence, and the knowledge I have gained over the years, where I am now could've never been possible.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/jhlee0133.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Q How long have you been playing rhythm games ?</p>	
									
									
								<p>A 1.5 Years</p>
									
								<p>Q What are some things that you practice regularly to improve?</p>
									
								<p>A I practice accuracy, which is very important as being more accurate can boost other skills.</p>
									
								<p>Q Has playing rhythm games taught you any valuable strategies that can be applied to other activites?</p>
									
								<p>A Yes, I have learned a few strategies, and mindsets that can be applied to other activities. One is that you cannot force any specific day to be a good day or not, you just have to do the best you can with that days set of conditions. Also even if you think you will have a bad day you might suprise yourself!</p>
									
								<p>Q Do you think that playing rhythm games can help everyone learn crucial ways to attack problems in everyday life?</p>
								<p>A Definitely, I feel like I can approach many different scenarios in my environment of school and rock climbing, with strategies I have learned from playing various rhythm gaming!</p>

								<section><h2 class="major">Strategies</h2>
									<p> The strategies listed below can be applied to real life scenarios, and other games if you tried hard enough. </p>
									<p> 1. Everyday will not always give the same performance. You have good days and bad days, without bad days you can never have good days. But really, any day can be a good day. </p>
									<p> 2. If you put in more work than everyone else, you will eventually surpass those which you were competing against.</p>
									<p> 3. Everything you do should have a goal, there is no point in doing anything if you dont have some sort of an end goal, planning what you need to do to achieve this goal is key.</p>
									<p> 4. Pushing yourself hard is a very good practice, but taking it too far can injure yourself contributing negative velocity towards you getting better at the sport in which you practice this strategy. Always practice moderation with any of these strategies!
									<p> Using these four strategies have proven to be worth it for me and my teammates! With enough work you would really be suprised what you are capable of.</p>
